       Hi, I’m Sahithi — a web creator passionate about clean design, meaningful user experiences, and bringing ideas to life through Wix.
Even with just two projects, I’ve focused on quality, clarity, and strong visual storytelling. I believe great design doesn’t depend on the number of projects, but the thought behind them.
I’m continuously learning, experimenting, and building — and I’m excited to grow further through this internship.
